              <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Nghi (pronounced "ne:É™") and I'm a current senior studying CS at MIT with interests in design, HCI, AI, and languages.<br></br> 
             In my free time, I love to doodle, play tennis, tutor, watch Sailor Moon, shop, and explore bakeries / Vietnamese restaurants. <br></br>
              I created this website for the intent of relearning React and also using it as a journal to keep myself accountable for staying on track with drawing. Feel free to look around!</p> <br></br>
